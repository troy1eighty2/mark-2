  "manifestModalHeader": "Dear SIH Users",
  "manifestModalContentPt1": "Due to the migration of the extension to Google Manifest v3 standards, older versions of Steam Inventory Helper will lose some functionality, including: automatic trade acceptance, item re-listing, price information retrieval, etc. To preserve the extension's capabilities, it is necessary to install the new version of the application, which will be updated automatically once it is ready. This will require granting additional permissions to the new version. Let's consider some of them:<br><br><strong>declarativeNetRequest</strong>, <strong>declarativeNetRequestFeedback</strong>, and <strong>cookies</strong> - these permissions are necessary to restore the current functionality. Previously, these permissions were available to all applications by default in the second version of the manifest, but now they are separated into individual items.<br><br><strong>management</strong> - the chrome.management API is required to determine which applications are used together with SIH. This is necessary for several purposes:<br><br>Avoid conflicts with other applications, where collaboration leads to data display failures on the page or within SIH functionality.<br><br>Scammer control. We often receive complaints about skin theft, and during investigations, we find that users have installed applications that manipulate trades or automatically purchase items at inflated prices. We will be able to collect lists of such applications and warn users about threats to their Steam accounts.<br><br><strong>unlimitedStorage</strong> - needed to speed up application performance by using more than 5 MB of memory.<br><br><strong>chrome.proxy</strong> - for the convenience of using international platforms. This is necessary so that requests to third-party platforms, such as Buff, are available directly to the user without using third-party VPN services.<br><br>We strive not only to preserve all functionality but also to add new features, such as comparing item prices with other platforms and accelerating the process of loading prices directly. To achieve this, we need to change the permissions format and request additional permissions from you, including access to all sites. This access is necessary for direct queries to price sources, without using our servers. We will request it only once to avoid repeated requests. You can always deny any access in the extension settings.<br><br>SIH continues to remain transparent, so all changes and permissions will be described and added to our updated ",
